# Graph Test Case Generator

#### An app to generate graph problems test cases by drawing the graph


How it works
------------
1. Enter the number of nodes and click on **Generate Graph** button.
2. Choose whether it is a directed grpah or undirected.
3. Drag and drop nodes to adjust their position.
4. To add an edge, click on the first node then click on the second node.
5. To delete an edge, follow the same above step.

    _**Note: **_ in Case of directed grpahs you have to click on the source node then on the destination node (in order).

6. The test case follows the typical format in all graph problems:
   - The first line consists on two integers, (n) & (m), where (n) is the number of nodes and (m) is the number of edges.
   - (m) lines follow, each containing two integers (i) & (j), meaning that there is an edge between node (i) and node (j).

7. The app currently supports unweighted graphs only.
